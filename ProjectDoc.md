    In this document, all rules and requirements on how to proceed with defining and
implementing the primer capstone project are defined.
For this project, you get to decide as a group what you are going to implement.
    However, certain rules and requirements must be met.
Project Definition
For this project, create a document where you should:
    • Name it as following: 
        PROJECT_NAME [members names separated by comma].
    • Provide a project name and a brief description of your project 
        (no more than six [6] lines).
    • Define at least four (4) additional requirements on top of the mandatory ones.
    o Feel free to define additional stretch goals to accomplish if MVP
        (Minimum Viable Product) is met ahead of schedule.
    After the document is approved, you can create a git repository to house the project.
    Please ensure you invite me to the repository.
